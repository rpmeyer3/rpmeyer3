_> CSCI 2670 - Classwork 13
__ <!> Instructions
|> Create a \graf document with your answers to the following problems.  Save your work as a Grafstate file with the extension **{.graf.txt} and upload it to eLC.
|> You may work in small groups.  You must identify your group on eLC.
|> Only one student in the group should do the eLC  submission.
|> Look at your file when you save it and *{before} submitting it to eLC to make sure it is what you intend to submit.  Check eLC *{after} submitting your file to make sure the correct file was uploaded.  It is your responsibility to submit the correct file.
|> The last version of your answer file that you submit before the deadline is the one that will be graded. If you submit the wrong file and submit a replacement after the deadline, then the usual late policy will apply.
|>  All Grafstate files should compile when the TA loads them into the Grafstate Shell. A file that does not compile will not be graded.
@{*}All TMs must be deterministic.

__ @{task} Exercises
Let A={w|w is a binary string containing at least 2 consecutive *{1}s !{and} an even number of \[1]s}.  Let B={a^ib^jc^k:0 \lt i \lt j \lt k}.
//
(1) Show the YES/NO table for A and B.
//
(2) Construct a @mredtn @fn to show that A\mred B.  Write the \graf code for a Turing machine that computes your @mredtn @fn.
//
(3) Choose a string w_Y that represents YES for A and a string w_N that represents NO for A.  Show the simulation output for your TM on w_Y and w_N.
//
(4) Prove that your @fn from @{(2)} has the @mredtn property.
//
(5) Prove that E_{CFG} \mred E_{PDA}.
> [a] Find a mapping reduction function.
> [b] Prove that your function has the mapping reduction property.
