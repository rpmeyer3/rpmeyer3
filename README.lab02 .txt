Download Lab02.c to before reading this:

This program intakes two parameters in the command prompt. These two parameters are used to display the binary translation of the decimal numbers entered in the command-line as well as display the hamming distance between the two decimal numbers.

 The expected input looks like this:
	./Lab02.out <num1> <num2>
with any values being able to substitute in for num one and num two as long as there is a space between the two. 

The expected output is supposed to look as such for example:

100100101001 is the bit string for 2345
000000000101 is the bit string for 5
5 is the Hamming distance between the bit strings
 
This is the end of the file, it doesn't have any other functionality other than to do computation on two decimal numbers in he command line. Thank you for trying it out.

for collateral and my own safety: this is a sample from my own command line...

rpm04447@csci-vcf3:~/csci1730/lab02$ ./lab02.out 47902 457
1011101100011110 is the bit string for 47902
0000000111001001 is the bit string for 457
11 is the Hamming distance between the bit strings
