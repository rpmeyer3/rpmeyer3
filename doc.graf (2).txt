_> CSCI 2670 - Classwork 6
__ <!> Instructions
|> Create a \graf document with your answers to the following problems.  Save your work as a Grafstate file with the extension **{.graf.txt} and upload it to eLC.
|> You may work in small groups.  You must identify your group on eLC.
|> Only one student in the group should do the eLC  submission.
|> Look at your file when you save it and *{before} submitting it to eLC to make sure it is what you intend to submit.  Check eLC *{after} submitting your file to make sure the correct file was uploaded.  It is your responsibility to submit the correct file.
|> The last version of your answer file that you submit before the deadline is the one that will be graded. If you submit the wrong file and submit a replacement after the deadline, then the usual late policy will apply.
|>  All computational structures (i.e., automata and grammars) should be coded using Grafstate \[:+] syntax. Working automata code should produce a state diagram.
|>  All Grafstate files should compile when the TA loads them into the Grafstate Shell. A file that does not compile will not be graded.

__ @{task} Exercises
> Consider the following PSG:
//
//
:+ psg G_1
S->NP VP
NP->D N
VP->V NP
D->the
N->cat|dog
V->chases
done.
//
//
//
:sim G_1 the cat chases the dog
//
//
(1) List __{all} sentences belonging to L(G_1).
The dog chases the cat
The cat chases the dog
The dog chases the dog
The cat cahses the cat
\;
<!> For Q2, Q6, and Q7, you should create new PSGs without just overwriting your previous answers. If you haven't created new PSGs, you will not receive full credit.
\;
(2) Write \graf code for a !{new PSG G_2} by modifying G_1 to add the following words to your lexicon: *{dogs, cats, chase}
PSG G_2
S -> NP VP
NP -> D N
VP -> V NP
D -> the
N -> cat |dog |cats | dogs
V -> chase | chases
\;
[i] Add the appropriate !{lexical rules} to your grammar to handle the new words !{@wo} adding new phrase rules or variables.  Test your grammar on some sentences.
\;
(*) Your new grammar should derive all of the sentences accepted by G_1 in addition to others.  A sentence is said to be !{grammatical}, *{according to a grammar}, if it is accepted by that grammar.  Thus, all sentences accepted by your new grammar are grammatical according to *{your} new grammar.
\;
(3) Give two new sentences that can be derived by G_2 that are also grammatical according to the English language.
The cats chase the dog
The dogs chase the cat
\;
(4) The sentence *{the dogs chases the cat} is not considered grammatical according to English but it can be derived from G_2.  List two other sentences that are derived by G_2 but are not considered grammatical in English.
The dogs chases the dogs
The dogs chases the cat
\;
(5) Explain why your new grammar allows your sentences from @{(4)} instead of rejecting them as ungrammatical.
The new grammar allows these sentences because it does not enforce subject-verb agreement. The verb form should agree with the subject in number (singular or plural). The grammar G_2 does not distinguish between singular and plural subjects when selecting the verb form.
\;
(6) Create a !{new PSG G_3} by modifying your PSG from @{(2)} to add new phrase rules that address your discovery in @{(5)}.  Your new grammar should derive sentences like *{the dog chases the cat} while rejecting sentences like *{the dogs chases the cat}.
PSG G_3
S -> NP_S VP_S | NP_P VP_P
NP_S -> D N_S
NP_P -> D N_P
VP_S -> V_S NP
VP_P -> V_P NP
D -> the
N_S -> cat | dog
N_P -> cats | dogs
V_S -> chases
V_P -> chase
\;
[i] You may add new variables to your grammar.
\;
(7) Create a !{new PSG G_4} by modifying your PSG in @{(6)} to include the adjectives *{big}, *{fast} and *{slow}.  You will need to add lexical rules and phrase rules.  Your PSG should accept sentences like *{the big big fast cat chases the slow dog}.
PSG G_4
S -> NP_S VP_S | NP_P VP_P
NP_S -> D R* N_S
NP_P -> D R* N_P
VP_S -> V_S NP
VP_P -> V_P NP
R* -> R R* | Îµ
D -> the
N_S -> cat | dog
N_P -> cats | dogs
V_S -> chases
V_P -> chase
R -> big | fast | slow

<!> __{Do not} write rules specifically to address the @exms in the exercises.
