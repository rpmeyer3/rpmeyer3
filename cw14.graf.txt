__ <!> Instructions
|> Create a \graf document with your answers to the following problems.  Save your work as a Grafstate file with the extension **{.graf.txt} and upload it to eLC.
|> You may work in small groups.  You must identify your group on eLC.
|> Only one student in the group should do the eLC  submission.
|> Look at your file when you save it and *{before} submitting it to eLC to make sure it is what you intend to submit.  Check eLC *{after} submitting your file to make sure the correct file was uploaded.  It is your responsibility to submit the correct file.
|> The last version of your answer file that you submit before the deadline is the one that will be graded. If you submit the wrong file and submit a replacement after the deadline, then the usual late policy will apply.
|>  All Grafstate files should compile when the TA loads them into the Grafstate Shell. A file that does not compile will not be graded.

__ @{task} Exercises
You are going to prove that ~{EQ_TM} is undecidable by showing A_TM \mred ~{EQ_TM}.
//
(1) Show the YES/NO table for A_TM and ~{EQ_TM}.
//
(2) Construct a computable @fn f to show that A_TM \mred ~{EQ_TM}.
//
(3) Prove that your @fn from @{(2)} has the @mredtn property.
//
(4) Prove that the problem of finding the maximum element in an array of n integers is in the class P by demonstrating the Big-\O  time complexity of a straightforward algorithm that solves the problem.
