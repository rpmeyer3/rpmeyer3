__ <!> Instructions
//
> |> Create a \graf document with your answers to the following problems.  Save your work as a Grafstate file with the extension **{.graf.txt} and upload it to eLC.
> |> You may work in small groups.  List in your document *{all} of the students in your group.
> |> Only one student in the group should do the eLC  submission
> |> Look at your file when you save it and *{before} submitting it to eLC to make sure it is what you intend to submit.  Check eLC *{after} submitting your file to make sure the correct file was uploaded.  It is your responsibility to submit the correct file.
> |> The last version of your answer file that you submit before the deadline is the one that will be graded. If you submit the wrong file and submit a replacement after the deadline, then the usual late policy will apply.
> |>  All computational structures (i.e., automata and grammars) should be coded using Grafstate \[:+] syntax. Working automata code should produce a state diagram.
> |>  All Grafstate files should compile when the TA loads them into the Grafstate Shell. A file that does not compile will not be graded.
