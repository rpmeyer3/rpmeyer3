b.) Comparing the lengths of the resulting regular expressions, we observe that the original regular expression (a\u(ba*b(a\ubb*a)))*ba*\uba*b has an approximate length of 27 characters, while the resulting regular expression aba* \u a*ba*b ((bb*(aa*b) \u aa*b)a*b)* has an approximate length of 33 characters. This indicates a significant increase in length.The pattern in the removal order that led to the longer expression can be identified by examining the states removed: q_1 -> q_4 -> q_3 -> q_2. This order may have introduced additional complexity due to the interconnectedness of the states. Removing states with more transitions or those that are central to the automatonâ€™s structure can lead to more complex regular expressions, as seen in this case.
