_> CSCI 2670 - Classwork 7
__ <!> Instructions
|> Create a \graf document with your answers to the following problems.  Save your work as a Grafstate file with the extension **{.graf.txt} and upload it to eLC.
|> You may work in small groups.  You must identify your group on eLC.
|> Only one student in the group should do the eLC  submission.
|> Look at your file when you save it and *{before} submitting it to eLC to make sure it is what you intend to submit.  Check eLC *{after} submitting your file to make sure the correct file was uploaded.  It is your responsibility to submit the correct file.
|> The last version of your answer file that you submit before the deadline is the one that will be graded. If you submit the wrong file and submit a replacement after the deadline, then the usual late policy will apply.
|>  All computational structures (i.e., automata and grammars) should be coded using Grafstate \[:+] syntax. Working automata code should produce a state diagram.
|>  All Grafstate files should compile when the TA loads them into the Grafstate Shell. A file that does not compile will not be graded.

__ <!> You can use the format below to create a table in Grafstate:
//
//
:fig table
x # x^2 # x^3
1 # 1 # 1
2 # 4 # 8
3 # 9 # 27
done.

:+ cfg G7
V={S,X, Y,A, B}
v0=S
S={a,b}

(a) Use the CYK algorithm to demonstrate that that the string @{[bbba]} is derived by G7.  Show the entire CYK table.
\;
(b) Use the CYK algorithm to demonstrate that that the string @{[abba]} is not derived by G7.  Show the entire CYK table.
